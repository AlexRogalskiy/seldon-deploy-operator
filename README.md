# Seldon Deploy Operator

This operator can be used for installing instances of Seldon Deploy. Built with operator-sdk.

## Building

To build and push just the operator:
```bash
make docker-build
make docker-push
```
To also build and push the bundle:
```bash
make update_openshift
```

## Testing

### KIND Full Deploy Stack

To test in KIND with entire stack:

* First run kind-setup.sh from seldon-deploy repo.
* Next run `make install`
* Then `make deploy`
* Then `kubectl apply -n seldon-system -f ./examples-testing/kind-full-setup.yaml`
* Then `make open_kind`

### KIND no dependencies

This is a minimal setup just for checking installation. No Deploy features work.

* `kind create cluster`
* `make install`
* `make deploy`
* `kubectl apply -n seldon-system -f ./examples-testing/kind-minimal-setup.yaml`
*  Port-forward to deploy to see UI, though you can't deploy anything in this setup.

### OLM Deployment

First need a cluster e.g. `kind create cluster`.

For KIND or other clusters without OLM, we [first install OLM](https://sdk.operatorframework.io/docs/olm-integration/quickstart-bundle/)

* Install OLM - `operator-sdk olm install` (tested with 0.17)

* Install marketplace - `make operator-marketplace`

Now [create](https://redhat-connect.gitbook.io/certified-operator-guide/ocp-deployment/operator-metadata/creating-the-metadata-bundle), push and [validate the bundle](https://redhat-connect.gitbook.io/certified-operator-guide/ocp-deployment/operator-metadata/creating-the-csv)

* All done in `make update_openshift`

Create a catalog_source

```bash
kubectl create -f tests/catalog-source.yaml
```

Check

```
kubectl get catalogsource seldon-deploy-catalog -n marketplace -o yaml
```

Create operator group

```bash
kubectl create -f tests/operator-group.yaml
```

Create Subscription

```bash
kubectl create -f tests/operator-subscription.yaml
```
Check the Subscription and CSV:
```bash
kubectl get subscriptions.operators.coreos.com -n marketplace seldon-deploy-operator-subsription -o yaml
kubectl get ClusterServiceVersion -n marketplace
```
Note here the operator will be namespace only ((OwnNamespace mode)[https://catalog.redhat.com/software/operators/detail/5f0f35842991b4207fcdb202/deploy]) so will only manage SeldonDeploy instances in marketplace namespace.

Now we create a deploy instance.

* `kubectl create ns seldon-logs || true`
* `kubectl apply -n marketplace -f ./examples-testing/kind-minimal-setup.yaml` (or full if stack is present, see above for `kind-full-setup.yaml`)

If using `kind-minimal-setup.yaml` then this is all you can do.

If using the full stack then we can run demos. We'll need to apply a license, either in the UI or using `make apply_license_kind`. Open with `make open_kind`

### Testing on OpenShift

Before testing a new version make sure `make update_openshift` has been run.

Create catalog source
```bash
kubectl create -f tests/catalog-source-openshift.yaml
```
Check
```bash
kubectl get catalogsource seldon-deploy-catalog -n openshift-marketplace -o yaml
```
Choose the operator in the UI. Be sure to get the right version.

If clusterwide then check with:
```bash
kubectl get subscriptions.operators.coreos.com -n openshift-operators seldon-deploy-operator -o yaml
```
Adjust namespace if not clusterwide.

Use [installation google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Z1mYh0ZlNWHypgqVD64y6rAq0Bz6WW_LFXc0D0Big74/edit?usp=sharing) for setting up dependencies or running minimal version.


TEST END TO END

CORE 1.5.0 LINKUP, SERVERLESS AND ECK ELASTIC WORKING NOW
ARGO AND MINIO NOT CERTIFIED BUT DO WORK. SEE https://github.com/SeldonIO/seldon-deploy-operator/issues/13

NEED TO TRY PLUGGING IN RH CONTAINER REGISTRY VERSIONS. SEE CSV IN MASTER BRANCH FOR HOW TO REPLACE THEM. 

UBI VERSIONS OF NEW IMAGES
SCRIPTS LIKE OLD openshift-full-setup ? IS IT WORTH IT AS THEY CHANGE ANYWAY? NO

HAVE SCRIPTS FOR CERTIFIED PACKAGEMANIFESTS
BUT CERT BUNDLE FAILING VALIDATION
NEED TO PUSH THE IMAGES, INCL CERT BUNDLE
SEE IMAGES.md
RH CONNECT PROJECTS
THEN GET SCANS WORKING

CAN USE https://redhat-connect.gitbook.io/partner-guide-for-red-hat-openshift-and-container/certify-your-operator/certify-your-operator-bundle-image/creating-operator-bundle-image-project

TESTED THE MINIO IMAGE FROM THE PR BUT SHOULD PROBABLY DOUBLE-CHECK THE UBI ONE TOO
COULD PUBLISH IT FIRST THOUGH

### Scorecard

First have a bundle built. Then `make scorecard`

TODO: this fails. Do I have to use quay as seems it can't pull from dockerhub?

## Maintaining This Project

Each new release needs to be based on the latest seldon deploy helm chart. 

TODO: see previous version but makefile has all changed
